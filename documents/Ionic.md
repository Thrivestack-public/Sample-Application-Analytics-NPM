# Ionic Integration

## ⚠️ Currently Unsupported

**Ionic is currently not supported by ThriveStack Analytics.**

### Why Ionic is Unsupported

ThriveStack Analytics is designed for web browsers and relies on browser-specific APIs. Ionic applications run in a native mobile environment, which means:

- No access to browser APIs (localStorage, cookies, etc.)
- Different JavaScript runtime (WebView vs browser)
- Native UI components instead of DOM elements
- Network requests handled differently
- No web-specific tracking capabilities

### Alternative Solutions

If you're building an Ionic application, consider these alternatives:

1. **Mobile Analytics Platforms**:
   - Firebase Analytics
   - Mixpanel Mobile SDK
   - Amplitude Mobile SDK
   - Segment Mobile SDK
   - AppsFlyer

2. **Ionic-Specific Analytics**:
   - **Firebase Analytics for Ionic**: Official Google Analytics
   - **Mixpanel Ionic SDK**: User behavior analytics
   - **Amplitude Ionic SDK**: Product analytics
   - **Custom Analytics**: Build your own tracking system

3. **WebView Integration**: If your app has web content, you can integrate ThriveStack in WebView components

### Future Support

We're actively working on expanding ThriveStack support to include:
- Ionic applications
- Mobile-specific tracking

**Note**: While Ionic itself is unsupported, you can still use ThriveStack in Ionic WebView components that display web content.
