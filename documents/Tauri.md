# Tauri Integration

## ⚠️ Currently Unsupported

**Tauri is currently not supported by ThriveStack Analytics.**

### Why Tauri is Unsupported

ThriveStack Analytics is designed for web browsers and relies on browser-specific APIs. Tauri applications run in a desktop environment, which means:

- Different security model and permissions
- Desktop-specific APIs instead of web APIs
- Different network handling
- No web-specific tracking capabilities
- Desktop application limitations

### Alternative Solutions

If you're building a Tauri application, consider these alternatives:

1. **Desktop Analytics Platforms**:
   - Firebase Analytics
   - Mixpanel Desktop SDK
   - Amplitude Desktop SDK
   - Segment Desktop SDK
   - Custom analytics implementation

2. **Tauri-Specific Analytics**:
   - **Firebase Analytics for Tauri**: Official Google Analytics
   - **Mixpanel Tauri SDK**: User behavior analytics
   - **Amplitude Tauri SDK**: Product analytics
   - **Custom Analytics**: Build your own tracking system

3. **WebView Integration**: If your app has web content, you can integrate ThriveStack in WebView components

### Future Support

We're actively working on expanding ThriveStack support to include:
- Tauri applications
- Desktop-specific tracking
- Native UI interaction monitoring

**Note**: While Tauri itself is unsupported, you can still use ThriveStack in Tauri WebView components that display web content.
